## ⚙️ Lab 1

Run the following command in the terminal:
```
./test.sh
```

If you got permission denied, first run this and then try running './test.sh' command:
```
chmod 777 test.sh
```

The test.sh file simply generates the main_demo executable file using 'make' command (GCC and CMake must be installed on the system) and then runs the main_demo using this command: 

```
./main_demo
```
You can simply use 'make' command (This command uses the contents of the Makefile) to generate the executable file and manually run the program to see if it works.
